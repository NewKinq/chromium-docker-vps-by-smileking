# Chromium Docker VPS by Smileking

Run a full Chromium browser on your VPS using Docker Compose and noVNC. Access it directly in your browserâ€”no extra apps needed.

##  Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Smileking/chromium-docker-vps-by-smileking.git
   cd chromium-docker-vps-by-smileking

2. Start the container:

##  Access the Browser

Open in your browser:
```
http://<your-server-ip>:5800
```

Login with:
- **Username:** `kasm_user`
- **Password:** `12345678`  
  (Set this in `docker-compose.yml` via `VNC_PW`)

Alternatively, use a VNC client:
```
<your-server-ip>:5900
```

##  Configuration
